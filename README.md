# Employee
Create a class called Employee that includes three instance variables—a first name (type String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, do not set its value. Write a test app named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Accept the user input for an Employee and display the object’s yearly salary. Then give the Employee a 10% raise and display the Employee’s yearly salary again.

# Sample Output
